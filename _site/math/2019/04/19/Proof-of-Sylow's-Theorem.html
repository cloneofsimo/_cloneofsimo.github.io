    <p>The first thing we learn in number theory is (I actually don’t remember
that well, as it was something like 5 years ago) is probably multiples
and divisors. From that one naturally arise the question
of diophantine equations and <script type="math/tex">(\text{mod})</script> arithmetic. One of the thing
that I remember quite clearly is the fact that one can always think
of number <script type="math/tex">u\in\mathbb{Z}/nm\mathbb{Z}</script>, given <script type="math/tex">gcd(m,n)=1</script>, <script type="math/tex">u_{1}\in\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}</script>,</p>

<p><script type="math/tex">u_{2}\in\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z}</script> that satisfy</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">u_{1}=u(\text{mod} n),u_{2}=u(\text{mod} m)</script>

<p>This really seems intuitive, but indeed the similar feeling arise
when we study ‘‘Sylow’s Theorem’’. We will post two different proof
of the theorem in this post and the next. The context is based on the textbook
by <strong>Victor P Snaith</strong></p>

<p>Sylow’s Theorem:</p>

<p>Let <script type="math/tex">G</script> be a finite group with order<script type="math/tex">p^{k}m</script> and <script type="math/tex">gcd(p,m)=1</script>.
Then subgroup <script type="math/tex">H</script> of <script type="math/tex">G</script> exists that <script type="math/tex">|H|=p^{k}</script>.</p>

<p>Before we go for the proof, one must know the following concepts.
If you don’t know them, go ahead and study them on wikipedia. It
is nice enough.</p>

<h3 id="conjugacy-class-of-a"><strong>Conjugacy class of <script type="math/tex">a</script></strong></h3>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">C_{a}=\{\text{all }z\in G\text{ | }z=bab^{-1}\text{for some }b\in G\}</script>

<p>Conjugacy class of a is not always a group. Also, they are disjoint
or equal if <script type="math/tex">a</script> is different and therefore <script type="math/tex">G</script> is disjoint union
of the distinct <script type="math/tex">C_{a}</script>s. Their cardinality is known in the following
way.</p>

<h3 id="centralizer-of-a"><strong>Centralizer of <script type="math/tex">a</script></strong></h3>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">Z_{a}=\{\text{all }z\in G\text{ | }za=az\}</script>

<p><script type="math/tex">Z_{a}</script> is normally a subgroup of <script type="math/tex">G</script>, therefore <script type="math/tex">[G:Z_{a}]</script> is
well defined. Indeed, <script type="math/tex">|C_{a}|=[G:Z_{a}|</script>.</p>

<h3 id="center-of-a-group"><strong>Center of a Group.</strong></h3>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">Z(G)=\{\text{all }z\in G\text{ | }zb=bz\text{ for all }b\in G\}</script>

<h3 id="first-isomorphism-theorem"><strong>First Isomorphism Theorem.</strong></h3>

<p>Let <script type="math/tex">\phi:G_{1}\rightarrow G_{2}</script>be a homomorphism. Then <script type="math/tex">\ker(\phi)</script>
is a normal subgroup of <script type="math/tex">G_{1}</script>and there is an isomorphism of the
form</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\Phi:G_{1}/\ker(\phi)\longrightarrow^{\cong}\text{im}(\phi)</script>

<p>For all <script type="math/tex">a\in G</script> that do not lie in <script type="math/tex">Z(G)</script>, denote them <script type="math/tex">a_{1},\cdots,a_{v}.</script>
One can see that those that lie on <script type="math/tex">Z(G)</script> have conjugacy class with
element only on themselves, thus <script type="math/tex">|C_{a}|=1</script>. This means</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">|G|=|Z(G)|+\sum_{j=1}^{v}[G:Z_{a_{j}}]</script>

<p>Now inductively, one can assume that the theorem holds for all group
with order smaller than <script type="math/tex">|G|</script>.</p>

<h2 id="case-1">Case 1.</h2>

<p>If there are some element <script type="math/tex">a_{j}</script> that <script type="math/tex">gcd(p,[G:Z_{a_{j}}])=1</script>,
then <script type="math/tex">v_{p}(|Z_{a_{j}}|)=k</script>.</p>

<p>Clearly <script type="math/tex">Z_{a_{j}}\neq G</script> therefore <script type="math/tex">% <![CDATA[
|Z_{a_{j}}|<|G| %]]></script> , and theorem
holds.</p>

<h2 id="case-2">Case 2.</h2>

<p>We are left with the case when all <script type="math/tex">[G:Z_{a_{j}}]</script> is multiple of
<script type="math/tex">p</script> for all <script type="math/tex">j</script>s. This gives <script type="math/tex">p|\text{ }|Z(G)|</script>. Given that
<script type="math/tex">Z(G)</script> is finite abelian, one can use Cauchy’s theorem to find element
<script type="math/tex">y\in Z(G)</script> with order <script type="math/tex">p</script>.</p>

<p>Let <script type="math/tex">N</script> be the cyclic group generated by <script type="math/tex">y</script>, one can see that <script type="math/tex">N\lhd G</script>,
thus <script type="math/tex">|G/N|=|G|/p</script>. By induction, <script type="math/tex">G/N</script> has a subgroup <script type="math/tex">J</script> that
has order divisible by <script type="math/tex">p^{k-1}.</script> Consider the homomorphism</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\pi:G\rightarrow G/N,\pi(a)=Na</script>

<p>and also</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">U=\{z\in G\text{ | }\pi(z)\in J\}</script>

<p>Notice that <script type="math/tex">U</script> is a subgroup of <script type="math/tex">G</script> and <script type="math/tex">N</script> is the kernel of <script type="math/tex">\pi:U\rightarrow J</script>.
This is because if there is an element <script type="math/tex">r\notin N</script> that is <script type="math/tex">\pi(r)=N</script>,
this means <script type="math/tex">r=y^{n}</script> for some <script type="math/tex">n\in\mathbb{Z}</script>, which is again in
<script type="math/tex">N</script>. By the first isomorphism theorem, there is an isomorphism <script type="math/tex">U/N\cong J</script>. This means that</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">|U|=|N||U/N|=|N||J|=p\cdot p^{k-1}=p^{k}</script>

<p>which is the result we want. The induction starts with <script type="math/tex">G=\{e\}</script>,
which is trivial.</p>
