    <h2 id="annuities">Annuities</h2>
<p>AN annuity is a financial instrument that pays $$CF$$ dollars for $$T$$ years.</p>
<p>$!
PV = \sum_{t = 1}^{T}\frac{CF}{(1 + r)^t}
$!</p>
<p><strong>Make sure you know when the first cash flow begins: It starts tomorrow $$t = 1$$, not today!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Also it pays for T years, meaning, income at the end will be $$CF/(1 + r)^T$$.</strong></p>
<p>The above formula can also be expressed as:</p>
<p><code>$! \begin{aligned} PV &amp;= \frac{CF}{r} \Big( 1 - \frac{1}{(1 + r)^T} \Big) \\ &amp;= \frac{CF}{r} - \frac{1}{(1 + r)^T} \frac{CF}{r} \\ &amp;= PV_0 - PV_T \end{aligned} $!</code></p>
<p>Where $$PV_0$$ is value of the perpetuity today, and $$PV_T$$ is value of perpetuity at time $$T$$, but evaluated at today.</p>
<h3 id="annuity-example-mortgage-loan">Annuity Example: Mortgage Loan</h3>
<p>A 30 year mortgage is an annuity with 360 monthly payments, starting one from today. therefore monthly rate on a mortgage is computed as the quoted rate divided by 12.
$!
r_{monthly} = 0.09/12 = 0.0075 \text{ per month}
$!</p>
<p>Q1: To buy a house you need to take out a $ 1,200,000 fixed rate mortgage with 30 years to maturity, and a quoted interest rate of 9 %, What will be your monthly payment?</p>
<p><code>$! \$ 1.2 m  = \frac{C}{1 + r} + \frac{C}{(1+r)^2} + \ldots + \frac{C}{(1 + r)^{360}} \\ where\\ r = 9\% / 12 = 0.75 \% $!</code></p>
<p><code>$! PV = \frac{C}{r} \Big( 1 - \frac{1}{(1 + r)^{360}} \Big) $!</code></p>
<p>That gives <code>$$ C =\$ 9655 $$</code>, for 360 months.</p>
<h3 id="principle-and-interest-decompositions">Principle and Interest Decompositions</h3>
<p>Q2 : Of the first month&rsquo;s payment, how much was payed as <strong>interest</strong> and how much was paid as <strong>principal</strong>?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The monthly interest rate is 0.75 $, giving the first month&rsquo;s interest 0.0075 * $1,200,000 = $9,000.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Therefore we have $9000 as interest, and $655 as principal. $$\rarr$$ **The remaining balance becomes 1,200,000 - 655.</p>
<h2 id="level-coupon-bonds">Level Coupon Bonds</h2>
<p><em>recap</em>: Bonds are financial assets that has <strong>Fixed income</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Level coupon bond</strong> is the bond that has fixed level (same amount payments through the interval).</p>
<p>Most common bond has $$x$$ % semi -annual level coupon bound.</p>
<p>Here the $$x$$ is not the interest rate. It is the percentage of the principal to be paid every interval.</p>
<p><strong>example 1</strong> : 8% semi - annual level coupon bond pays $40 every six months on $1000 in principal. At maturity, it pays $1040, as principal + 40.</p>
<p><strong>example 2</strong> : WHat are the payments to a 5% semi - annual level coupon bond, $100 million, due in 2.5 years?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>it has to pay you 2.5% * principal every 6 months, therfore 2.5 mil in 6 month, for 2.5 years, + 100 mil
This gives 2.5 * 2.5 + 100 mil.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Typically, coupon price is same as face value. (the last payment you get). Of course this wouldn&rsquo;t be the case for zero coupon bond.</p>
<p>Q3: Is coupon rate of a bond equal to the interest rate?
No:</p>
<p>Q4: What is the interest rate on an IBM 3.5 % semi - annual coupon bond?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>we actually don&rsquo;t know, as the value you receive is 3.5%/2 * FV, and the price today (PV) is unknown. This explains the Q3 as well.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="yield-to-maturity-ytm">Yield to Maturity (YTM)</h3>
<p>Suppose that a one year risk free, zero coupon bond with a $1000 has an initial price of $966.18</p>
<p><code>$! \begin{aligned} P_{0,T} &amp;= \frac{F}{(1 + r_{0,T})^T}\\ 966.18 &amp;= \frac{1000}{1 + r_{0,1}} \\ r_{0,1} &amp;= \frac{1000}{966.18} - 1 = 0.035 \end{aligned} $!</code></p>
<p><strong>Yield to Maturity is the rate of return earned on a bond held to maturity. also called &ldquo;promised yield&rdquo;.</strong>
Also called IRR (internal rate of return)
Also called annualized rate or return.</p>
<p>Q5: An insurance company offers a retirement annuity that pays $100,000 per year for 15 years and sells for $806,070, What is the implied interest rate that this insurance company is offering you?</p>
<p><code>$! \begin{aligned} P_0 &amp;= 806,070\\ PV &amp;= \frac{100,000}{r} \Big(1 - \frac{1}{(1+r)^{15}}\Big)\\ r &amp;= 9 \% \end{aligned} $!</code></p>
<p>If they were give with <strong>inflation compensator</strong> 3%, that is, that amount increases by 3% every year, the inflation rate would be:</p>
<p><code>$! \begin{aligned} P_0 &amp;= 806,070\\ PV &amp;= \frac{100,000}{r-3} \Big(1 - \frac{(1+3\%)^{15}}{(1+r)^{15}}\Big)\\ r &amp;= 11.76 \% \end{aligned} $!</code></p>
<p>Q6: In 2016 google had P/E ratio of 27. If the cost of capital was 8%, what was the market&rsquo;s expected growth rate?</p>
<p><code>$! \begin{aligned} P &amp;= \frac{E}{r - g} \\ 27 &amp;= \frac{1}{8 - g} \\ g &amp;= 4.2\% \end{aligned} $!</code></p>
<p>Q7: If the dealer said that you can have 12 month car loans with 9%, and they asked you to pay them $10900/12 = $908.33 per month, would they be correct?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No! If you are paying cash earlier than 1 year (that is, every month), you are actually paying them more than you have to!</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To be clear, if you were to pay &ldquo;at the interest rate of 9% per year&rdquo;, you would have to pay C such that:</p>
</blockquote>
<p><code>$! \$ 10,000 = \frac{C}{1 + r_m} + \frac{C}{(1+r_m)^2} + \ldots + \frac{C}{(1+r_m)^{12}}    $!</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p>where $$r_m$$ would be 0.721%, as <code>$$ (1 + r_m)^{12} = 1 + 9\% $$</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But if you were to pay &ldquo;at the interest rate of 9% per year&rdquo;,</p>
<p>What is the actual interest rate on the car dealer&rsquo;s proposed deal loan?</p>
<p><code>$! \$ 10,000 = \frac{908}{1 + r_m} + \frac{908}{(1+r_m)^2} + \ldots + \frac{908}{(1+r_m)^{12}}   \\ \\ r = 17.5 \% $!</code></p>
